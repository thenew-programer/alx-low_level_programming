splits a string into words

start: 
    first loop to know how many words are there
    alloc the memory for the arr that will contain the new wods
    loop to fill every element of the arr with words 
        1- strlen of word
        2- alloc memory for that word + '\0'
        3- strcpy to fill the arr
